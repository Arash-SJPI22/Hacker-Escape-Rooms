Project coding guidelines

Naming convention:

- BEM - Arash version 0.01a

  - each block should be self-contained and not carry the parrents name unless:
    - there is risk of multiple entities of the same block
    - : if so it should carry the closest contextual parrents name as shortend as possible with a hyfen.

  HTML/CSS:

  - Hypphen and lowercase
  - an-example

  JS:

  - camelCase
  - anExample

HTML semantics:

CSS structure:

- imports
- variabels
- general mixers
- general selector rules for elements
- classes in the same order as the html

- keywords in selectors/classes are ordered:
  - alphabeticly ascending
